      "about":"Tekken 8 for PC is just the latest in a long line of Tekken games: it is the eighth main game, and tenth release overall. But it is only the second game to be made available on PC: the first being Tekken 7. Tekken (the word comes from the Japanese Tetsu no ken, meaning ‘Iron Fist,’) is a fighting game, and in this game, the developers have perfected their understanding of what their players want from the game.",
